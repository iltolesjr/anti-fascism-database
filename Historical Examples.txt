Historical Examples of Democratic Decline and Authoritarianism
This document outlines several historical cases where democratic systems were undermined or collapsed, focusing on the methods used by those who took power, the reactions, mistakes made by the opposition, and potential actions that could have been taken.

Hungary (under Viktor Orbán)
Takeover: Gained power through democratic elections, with Fidesz securing a supermajority in 2010.

Methods of Authoritarianism:

Used parliamentary majority to legally change the constitution and laws (e.g., 2011 constitution) to centralize power and weaken checks and balances.

Exerted control over the judiciary and media through politically motivated appointments and regulatory changes.

Limited the space for independent civil society and opposition.

Reactions: Initial opposition was fragmented. Domestic protests occurred but faced challenges from the altered political system. The EU repeatedly raised concerns and pursued legal actions regarding rule of law violations.

Mistakes (Opposition/People):

Underestimating the extent of the planned systemic changes early on.

Inability to form a strong, unified opposition front.

What People Could Have Done:

More widespread and sustained non-violent resistance and civil disobedience against early constitutional and legal changes.

Greater efforts to unify opposition parties.

More effectively mobilizing international attention and leveraging EU mechanisms from the outset.

Poland (under Law and Justice - PiS)
Takeover: PiS won parliamentary elections in 2015.

Methods of Authoritarianism:

Implemented controversial changes to the judiciary, impacting the Constitutional Tribunal and other courts, raising concerns about judicial independence.

Increased state control over public media and used it for propaganda.

Targeted political opponents and critical voices.

Reactions: Significant domestic protests against judicial and media changes. Strong condemnation and legal action from the European Union.

Mistakes (Opposition/People):

Despite protests, PiS was able to implement changes due to its majority and control over state institutions.

Opposition was at times fragmented.

What People Could Have Done:

More sustained and unified civic action against changes to the judiciary.

More effective communication strategies to counter state media narratives.

Myanmar (Military Rule)
Takeover: History of military coups (e.g., 1962, 2021). The 2021 coup overthrew the elected government, based on unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.

Methods of Dictatorship:

Direct military rule, often suspending the constitution and imposing martial law.

Violent suppression of protests and armed resistance.

Jailing and killing of political opponents, activists, and journalists.

Control over state institutions and the economy.

Reactions: Widespread peaceful protests and civil disobedience, evolving into armed resistance. International condemnation and targeted sanctions, with limited impact on the military's control.

Mistakes (Opposition/People):

Inability to overcome the military's brutal willingness to use lethal force.

Historical divisions among opposition groups sometimes hindering unity.

What People Could Have Done:

Greater long-term strategic planning for resistance under extreme repression.

Building stronger alliances between civilian resistance and ethnic armed organizations.

More effective international pressure and decisive action.

Turkey (under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan)
Takeover: Gradual consolidation of power after becoming Prime Minister (2003) and later President.

Methods of Authoritarianism:

Constitutional amendments (e.g., 2017) shifting to a powerful executive presidency.

Increasing political control over the judiciary.

Widespread arrests and jailing of critics, especially after the 2016 coup attempt.

Pressure and control over media outlets.

Reactions: Protests (e.g., Gezi Park) met with strong government crackdowns. Increased political polarization. International concerns over rule of law and human rights.

Mistakes (Opposition/People):

Failure to build a broad and unified opposition capable of challenging Erdoğan's dominance.

Underestimating the use of democratic processes to dismantle checks and balances.

What People Could Have Done:

A more unified and consistent political opposition strategy.

Greater emphasis on strengthening civil society and independent media.

Nicaragua (under Daniel Ortega)
Takeover: Returned to power through elections in 2007.

Methods of Authoritarianism:

Eliminated presidential term limits through constitutional changes.

Consolidated control over all government branches and electoral institutions.

Suppressed independent media and civil society.

Violent crackdown on protests (e.g., 2018), using police and paramilitaries.

Jailing and exiling political opponents.

Reactions: Large-scale protests in 2018 met with brutal state violence. Many forced into exile. International condemnation and sanctions.

Mistakes (Opposition/People):

Underestimating the state's willingness to use extreme violence.

Fragmentation among opposition groups.

What People Could Have Done:

Developing more resilient forms of organization and resistance under repression.

Building stronger international solidarity and pressure.
